# UrbanDenoiser - Denoise for urban seismological noise

We develop a deep-learning-based denoising algorithm, UrbanDenoiser, to filter out urban seismological noise.
The model of UrbanDenoiser is present as 210906-023102.zip, which is trained by a transfer learning from DeepDenoiser (https://github.com/wayneweiqiang/DeepDenoiser), using waveform datasets containing rich noise sources from the urban Long Beach dense array and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) earthquake signals from the rural San Jacinto dense array.
